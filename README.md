This bot, still under development, is equipped with a large catalog of orders.

As you can see, the prefix for using Dumbot is __**"="**__.                                                                                                                  
It can be changed according to your wishes. However, be careful not to exceed two characters! Beyond that you will risk to forget it. ㇱ

Dumbot is available on all your platforms. Whether it's on your computers, laptops, phones or many others. Of course, you have to be Discord!
