Hello and welcome to **Dumbot**'s presentation page!
Dumbot is an incredible Discord bot. Created by two brilliant students, its goal is to replace the biggest bot and gather all their features. 
This bot, still under development, is equipped with a large catalog of orders. 
These commands have been created in order to bring peace, calm, laughter and help within your Discord servers.

Here is the list of commands that the dumbot is equipped with!

As you can see, the prefix for using Dumbot is **"="**.
It can be changed according to your wishes. However, be careful not to exceed two characters! Beyond that you will risk to forget it ^^'.
